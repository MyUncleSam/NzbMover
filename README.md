# How to use
 - Copy the files to a folder.
 - Modify nzbmover.cfg to your needs.
 - (Optional, maybe better reed "Browser" below) Right click on a .nzb file and choose "Open with". Then choose this exe.

 If all done all .nzb files should then be processed by this tool.
 But, as I have no clue about the icons, you get an ugly default exe icon. So maybe prefer setting it directly inside the browser. (See below.)

# Browser
If you download a file and open it, it first tries in the default application. But if there is none, it asks how to open. Choose the NzbMover.exe should work here.
(If it is the windows dialog, the browser does not support this which is doing the same as in "How to use" above.)
